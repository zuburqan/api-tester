API Tester is a tool written in golang. It's purpose is to performance test any API.

It exposes prometheus metrics are to be used to analyse APIs performance

## Metrics Exposed:

```shell
Total requests split by method, code and API endpoint

Failed requests split by method code and endpoint

Total journeys split by journey name

Failed journeys split by name

Request duration split by different time buckets (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 seconds)

Journey duration split by different time buckets (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 seconds)
```

## Configuration:

api-tester.conf : This is used to specify the following properties: 
```
destination: set it to any name you like, usually the name of the API. This will be used in metric names as a prefix

auth: specify the auth type for the API. Currently "no_auth", "basic" and "digest" auths are supported
client_timeout: default 60 seconds. This is the golang HTTP client timeout.

sleep: how long a user of the API waits before starting the journey set again (in seconds)
users: the number of users which will execute the journeys concurrently

log_level: defaults to "warn" where you will only see errors if any. change to "info" to see all requests being executed and to "debug" to see full response body and status code

stats_host: the prometheus metrics server host IP, that will expose these metrics to be collected

stats_port: the prometheus metrics server host port, that will expose these metrics to be collected

journeys: the journeys to be executed. This has the name, any setup requests, the actual requests and any cleanup requests if required
```

api-tester-connection.conf: This is used to specify the following properties:

```
host: the API host along with port. example: http://foobar.com:8080

username: username of API

password: password of API
```

The following is an example journey set for running against Transport for London (TFL) API
